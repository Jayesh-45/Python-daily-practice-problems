# Python-daily-practice-problems

- I create these little programs as experiments to play with Python, or to solve problems for myself. 
- I would gladly accept reviews and suggestions from others to improve, simplify, or make the codes more efficient.
- I provide the Problem statements, Solutions, and sometimes the working principle.
